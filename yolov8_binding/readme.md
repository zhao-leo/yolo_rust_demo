# A rust binding for yolov8 or higher aimed at detection

This create is a binding for yolov8 or higher.

Currently, it supports load module from a torchscript file.

it offers apis to load from a file, load from dir and load from bytes.

it offers apis to export to file or a dir.

I try my best to make it easy, but obviously it can just deal with the basic function.

If possible I will add more useful functions but currently it is a tool for my competition.
